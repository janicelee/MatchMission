<h3> Your Mission: Find All Matching Pairs of Robots </h3>

- Turn over any two cards at a time
- If they match, you've found a pair

- Remember which robots you saw and where
- The game ends when you've found all matching pairs and you'll get to see how fast you completed your mission
- Play again and again, a random set of robots will be dispatched for you!
